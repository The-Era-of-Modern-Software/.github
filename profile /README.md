## Description

The Era of Modern Software is a mentorship-driven space designed to help early-career and junior engineers grow through exposure to real-world software workflows and practices.

Our goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and the realities of professional engineering by providing an environment that closely mirrors how software is actually built, reviewed, and maintained in the industry.

Through guided mentorship, structured collaboration, and practical examples, engineers are encouraged to develop stronger technical judgment, understand real-world tradeoffs, and grow with a professional and thoughtful mindset.

## Vision & Principles

We believe that strong engineers are built through clarity of thinking, responsibility, and continuous learning — not just through tools or frameworks.

Our vision is to help engineers develop a business-aware, thoughtful mindset that allows them to reason about problems deeply, communicate clearly, and take ownership of their work.

The principles that guide this space:

- **Clarity over complexity**  
  Clear thinking, clear communication, and clear intent matter more than clever solutions.

- **Business-aware engineering**  
  Technical decisions should be informed by real business needs, constraints, and tradeoffs.

- **Ownership and responsibility**  
  Engineers are encouraged to take ownership of their work, follow through on decisions, and learn from outcomes.

- **Depth over surface-level knowledge**  
  We value understanding *why* things work, not just *how* to use them.

- **Structured problem breakdown**  
  Complex problems should be approached through clear, class-A breakdowns before jumping to solutions.

- **Critical thinking over blind execution**  
  Question assumptions, evaluate tradeoffs, and reason about decisions instead of following patterns blindly.

- **Safe space to ask and fail**  
  Asking questions, making mistakes, and learning from them are essential parts of growth.

- **Growth through reflection**  
  Mistakes are treated as learning opportunities when ownership and reflection are present.

## Structure

The organization is structured around long-running, real-world–inspired software projects that typically span a defined period (for example, around three months).

Each project is designed to simulate a full software development lifecycle, exposing engineers to how work is planned, executed, reviewed, and evolved over time.

Work within a project is generally organized around:

- **Project-based execution**  
  Participants collaborate on a shared product or system that evolves incrementally over time.

- **Task-driven work**  
  Work is broken down into tasks that reflect real engineering responsibilities, including implementation, investigation, refactoring, and documentation.

- **Learning and research tasks**  
  Some tasks focus on studying concepts, researching approaches, or understanding tradeoffs before implementation.

- **Iteration and review cycles**  
  Projects evolve through feedback, discussion, and review, reflecting how real teams refine software continuously.

This structure is intentionally designed to resemble real-world engineering environments rather than isolated exercises, helping participants develop both technical depth and professional workflow habits.

## Rules & Community Expectations

This space follows a high-standard, disciplined approach that reflects real professional engineering environments. Participation assumes responsibility, respect, and a willingness to grow.

### Expected behaviors

- **Ask questions freely and thoughtfully**  
  Curiosity is encouraged. Asking questions is part of learning and is always welcome when done with intent and effort.

- **Engage in respectful debate and discussion**  
  Ideas are meant to be challenged. Healthy disagreement, technical debate, and constructive pushback are encouraged when done respectfully.

- **Communicate like in a real work environment**  
  Interactions should be clear, professional, and purposeful, similar to how engineers collaborate in real teams.

- **Take ownership of your work**  
  Participants are expected to take responsibility for tasks they take on, follow through, and communicate clearly when issues arise.

- **Put effort into your work**  
  Contributions should reflect genuine effort, thought, and intent to learn — not minimal or careless submissions.

### Not acceptable

- Disrespectful or dismissive behavior toward others  
- Low-effort contributions without reasoning or explanation  
- Blaming others instead of reflecting on mistakes  
- Ignoring agreed-upon processes or collaboration norms  
- Creating an unprofessional or unsafe learning environment  

The goal is to create a space where high standards and psychological safety coexist — where engineers can challenge ideas, make mistakes, and grow through responsibility and reflection.
